# Digital Closet ‚Äì Project Context for Claude Code

> **Purpose:** This document provides essential project context for Claude Code, maximizing the value of the context window for rapid, accurate development assistance. It enables immediate understanding of the codebase architecture, conventions, and development patterns to ensure all contributions align with the project's standards for modularity, testability, and scalability.

---

## 1. Project Structure & Directory Layout

- **/src/screens/** ‚Äì UI screens (React components). ‚ÄúDumb‚Äù components: handle UI, user interaction, and navigation only.
- **/src/services/** ‚Äì All business logic, AsyncStorage, and data transformation. Service modules are the only place for side effects, persistence, or data manipulation.
- **/src/services/__tests__/** ‚Äì Jest regression and unit tests for all service modules.
- **/src/services/uuid.js** ‚Äì Universal, React Native‚Äìsafe UUID generation.
- **/src/services/garmentVisionService.js** ‚Äì GarmentVision pipeline: OpenAI-powered garment segmentation, mask, and retouching.
- **/src/services/imageProcessingService.js** ‚Äì Central abstraction for clothing article detection. Supports only Clarifai and OpenAI (garmentVision) providers. The mock provider and abstract interface were removed for code hygiene.

## 2. Design Patterns & Principles

- **Clean Architecture / MVVM**
  - UI (View/Screen) components are presentation-only.
  - All business logic, storage, and data flow are in service modules.
  - Easy to swap out service implementations or UI frameworks.
- **Component-Based Design System**
  - **/src/theme/** ‚Äì Centralized theme system (colors, spacing, typography, shadows)
  - **/src/components/common/** ‚Äì Reusable UI components (AppHeader, Button, EmptyState)
  - **Consistent Props**: All components follow similar prop patterns for easy learning
  - **Theme Integration**: All components use centralized theme system
- **Modularity:** Each module has a single responsibility and clear interface.
- **Testability:** All core logic is covered by Jest tests. New features require new tests.
- **Scalability:** Architecture supports future features (filtering, sharing, etc.) without major rewrites.

## 3. Data Flow & Example

- **Adding an Article:**
  1. User selects/crops articles in a screen (e.g., VerificationScreen.js).
  2. Screen calls a service (e.g., galleryService.js, garmentVisionService.js) to process, persist, or transform data.
  3. If using GarmentVision, the service:
      - Calls OpenAI for garment detection and mask generation
      - ### Image Generation
        - Uses OpenAI DALL-E **2** for generating garment images from text descriptions.
        - Output size is set to **512x512** for optimal cost, latency, and mobile display quality.
        - Once DALL-E 3 (or newer) supports smaller sizes or better cost/quality tradeoff, the pipeline will be upgraded accordingly.
      - Calls DALL-E edits for studio-style retouching
      - Returns bounding box, mask PNG, retouched image URL, and metadata
  4. Service returns results, which the screen displays or navigates with.

- **Provider Support and Code Hygiene:**
  - As of April 2025, only Clarifai and OpenAI (garmentVision) providers are supported in `imageProcessingService.js`.
  - The mock provider (`mockImageProcessingService.js`) and abstract interface (`IImageProcessingService.js`) were removed after confirming no active references or dependencies.
  - This cleanup reduces code bloat and ensures a maintainable, production-focused codebase.

- **No business logic in screens.**
- **All storage, filtering, and mutation in services.**

  - **Data Model:**
  - Article objects may now include:
    - `croppedImageUri`: Local cropped image (Clarifai pipeline)
    - `imageUri`: Original image (Clarifai pipeline)
    - `imageUrl`: Cloud/remote image (OpenAI/DALL-E pipeline)
    - `localImageUri`: Local persistent copy of remote images (added May 2025)
    - `wearCount`: Number of times the article has been worn (added May 2025)
    - `boundingBox`: { x, y, w, h }
    - `maskPngB64`: base64 PNG string
    - `retouchedUrl`: URL to studio-style image
    - `metadata`: extracted attributes (color, type, etc.)
  - **Image Field Fallback & Persistence:**
    - UI components (e.g., CategoryCarousel, CreateOutfitScreen) always render the first available image from `localImageUri`, `croppedImageUri`, `imageUri`, or `imageUrl`.
    - The `localImageUri` field (added May 2025) stores a local copy of remote images to solve the URL expiration issue with OpenAI DALL-E generated images.
    - Images are automatically downloaded and stored locally when articles are created or when the app starts up (via migration).
    - This ensures robust, multi-provider support (Clarifai, OpenAI, future pipelines) and prevents blank images even when remote URLs expire.
    - If no image field is present, a placeholder is shown.
  - **Outfit Usage & Wear Tracking:**
    - Outfits can be marked as worn via the OutfitDetailScreen.
    - The `wearCount` field tracks how many times each article has been worn.
    - When an outfit is marked as worn, the wearCount for all articles in that outfit is incremented.
    - Outfits also track their own wear count and last worn date for future features.

## 4. Development Commands

- **Start development server:**
  ```sh
  expo start
  ```
- **Run on specific platform:**
  ```sh
  expo start --ios    # iOS simulator
  expo start --android # Android emulator  
  expo start --web     # Web browser
  ```
- **Run tests:**
  ```sh
  npx jest
  ```

## 5. Testing Philosophy

- **Jest is used for all service modules.**
- **Regression suite:** Every meaningful new feature or bug fix should add a test case.
- **Test files live in `/src/services/__tests__/`**

## 6. Naming & Conventions

- **Service modules:** Named after their domain (e.g., galleryService.js, outfitService.js).
- **Screens:** Named after their UI function (e.g., GalleryScreen.js).
- **UUID:** Always use the provided uuid.js wrapper for unique IDs.

## 7. Extending & Onboarding

- **To add a new feature:**
  1. Implement business logic in a new or existing service module.
  2. Write Jest tests for all new logic and edge cases.
  3. Update or create screens to use the service (UI only).
  4. Update this document if architecture evolves.

- **For AI models:**
  - Read this file first to seed your context window.
  - Follow all separation-of-concerns and modularity principles.
  - Always suggest or add tests for new logic.

**This document is intentionally concise for maximal context utility. Update as the project grows or as new conventions are adopted.**

## 8. Recent Changes & Development Roadmap

### Recent Major Refactoring (July 2025)

**Comprehensive Component Library & Theme System Implementation**

1. **‚úÖ Centralized Theme System** (`src/theme/`)
   - **colors.js**: Consolidated 40+ hardcoded colors into semantic color system
   - **spacing.js**: 8px grid spacing constants for consistency

   - **Impact**: Eliminated 100+ hardcoded color values, enabled easy theme switching/dark mode

2. **‚úÖ AppHeader Component** (`src/components/common/AppHeader.js`)
   - **Variants**: `main` (dashboard), `navigation` (back button), `simple`
   - **Props**: title, showBackButton, rightElement, backgroundColor, showBorder
   - **Replaced**: Headers in HomeScreen, GalleryScreen, OutfitsScreen, OutfitDetailScreen
   - **Impact**: ~60 lines saved, consistent header behavior across app

3. **‚úÖ Button Component** (`src/components/common/Button.js`) 
   - **Variants**: primary, secondary, destructive, icon
   - **Features**: Loading states, icon support, accessibility, theme integration
   - **Replaced**: 8+ button patterns across VerificationScreen, CreateOutfitScreen, OutfitsScreen, OutfitDetailScreen
   - **Impact**: ~150+ lines saved, standardized button behavior

4. **‚úÖ EmptyState Component** (`src/components/common/EmptyState.js`)
   - **Variants**: fullscreen, inline, card for different contexts
   - **Features**: Loading states, error states, action buttons, flexible content
   - **Replaced**: Empty states in OutfitsScreen, HomeScreen, OutfitDetailScreen
   - **Impact**: ~100+ lines saved, consistent empty state UX

**Total Refactoring Impact**: ~310+ lines eliminated, consistent design system, easier maintenance

### Current Development Priorities

1. **üöÄ HIGH PRIORITY: ArticleCard Component** (In Progress)
   - **Target**: Extract article display patterns from CategoryCarousel, CreateOutfitScreen, VerificationScreen, OutfitDetailScreen
   - **Expected Impact**: ~200+ lines saved (biggest remaining win)
   - **Features**: Multiple layout variants, selection states, action buttons, image fallbacks

2. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - **Fix Large Functions**: Break down `galleryService.addArticles` (57 lines), `garmentVisionService.processGarmentImage` (56 lines)
   - **Standardize Error Handling**: Create consistent error patterns across services (~100+ lines saved)
   - **Expand Test Coverage**: Currently only 37% of services have tests

3. **Future Enhancements**
   - **Progressive Article Processing UI**: Show real-time processing feedback instead of silent waiting
   - **Category-Based Navigation**: Enhanced filtering and transitions
   - **Usage Analytics Dashboard**: Visualizations and insights
   - **Search and Filter Functionality**: Robust search across wardrobe

## 9. Future Improvements & Notes

### **User Experience Improvements**
- **Progressive article processing UI**: Currently when processing images with multiple clothing items, users see no feedback until ALL items are completely processed (detection + DALL-E generation + local storage). Should instead show items appearing one-by-one as they complete processing, with status indicators like "Analyzing image..." ‚Üí "Found 3 items" ‚Üí "Processing item 1/3..." ‚Üí Item 1 appears ‚Üí "Processing item 2/3..." ‚Üí Item 2 appears, etc. This creates a sense of progress rather than a long silent wait.

### **Navigation & Flow Issues**
- **Fix outdated screen references**: Some components still reference old "Gallery" screen name instead of "Wardrobe" - needs systematic review
- **OutfitsScreen render loop**: Component mounts repeatedly (5x) during navigation, possibly due to duplicate useEffect + useFocusEffect calling loadData()
